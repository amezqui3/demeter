# Describing `demeter`: using the Euler characteristic to quantify the shape and biology

## Description

Shape is data and data is shape. Biologists are accustomed to thinking about how the shape of biomolecules, cells, tissues, and organisms arise from the effects of genetics, development, and the environment. Traditionally, biologists use morphometrics to compare and describe shapes. The shape of leaves and fruits is quantified based on homologous landmarks&mdash; similar features due to shared ancestry from a common ancestor&mdash; or harmonic series from a Fourier decomposition of their closed contour. While these methods are useful for comparing many shapes in nature, they can not always be used: there may not be homologous points between samples or a harmonic decomposition of a shape is not appropriate. Topological data analysis (TDA) offers a more comprehensive, versatile way to quantify plant morphology. [TDA](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep01236) uses principles from algebraic topology to comprehensively measure shape in datasets, which reveal morphological features not obvious to the naked eye. In particular, [Euler characteristic curves (ECCs)](https://doi.org/10.1093/imaiai/iau011) serve as a succinct, computationally feasible topological signature that allows downstream statistical analyses. For example, ECCs have been successfully used to to determine the genetic basis of leaf shape in [apple](https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.18.00104), [tomato](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41438-019-0146-2), and [cranberry](https://10.7717/peerj.5461). 

Here we present `demeter`, a python package to quickly compute the ECC of any given grayscale image in linear time with respect to its number of pixels. With `demeter` we provide all the necessary tools to explore the ECC, which can be thought as a two-step procedure. First, we give an image its adequate topological framework, a dual cubical complex in this case. Second, we associate every pixel a number with a fixed real-valued function, known as a filter function. We provide a set of different filter functions that can highlight diverse features in the images, such as Gaussian density, eccentricity, or grayscale intensity. The `demeter` workflow can readily take either 2D pixel-based or 3D voxel-based images, use filter functions outside the ones provided with minimal wrangling, and overall benefit from the standard python ecosystem.

## To install

For now, the package has to be installed from source. You have to 

* download the code with:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/amezqui3/demeter/
```
* move to the directory:
```shell
cd demeter
```
* install with:
```shell
pip install -e .
```

* the `-e` flag is optional. It stands for _editable_, so changes in the source python files will be immediately reflected whenever importing the package.

The package can then be imported in a python shell with:
```shell
import demeter
```
